Hi all,

This patch to softfloat is intended to be the first in a series to add better
support for 80-bit extended precision floating point operations. These patches
will fix the inaccuracies found in target/i386's x87 fpu emulation.

Context:

Currently many of x87 instructions in the i386 emulator are translating
Floatx80 to double then calling into host's math library, and finally back to
Floatx80. Significant accuracy is lost during this process compared to real x87
hardware. For transcendental trig functions that use x87 instructions for
intermediate calculations, as much as 9 decimal places of accuracy is lost
compared to hardware.


Solution:

Most functions in these patches were ported by Laurent Vivier from functions
written by Andreas Grabher for Previous. The next section will explain the
licensing issues.

These functions performs the corresponding operation using Floatx80 without
rounding to double. The algorithms used in these implementaions can be found
here:
